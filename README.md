SBA 318: Express Server Application
Version: 1.0, Released on 07/25/23

Introduction:
Welcome to the Express Server Application project! This project was designed to showcase proficiency in Node.js and Express.js by implementing various features in a practical manner. Let's delve into the details of what this application offers.

Objectives Achieved:

Server Application Development:
I've successfully developed a server application using Node.js and Express.js. The application serves as the backbone for the entire project, facilitating data handling and routing.

RESTful API Creation:
One of the key achievements is the creation of a RESTful API using Express.js. This API follows the REST architectural principles, providing endpoints for various operations on data entities.

Middleware Implementation:
I've implemented custom middleware to handle specific tasks within the application. Additionally, error-handling middleware ensures robustness by gracefully handling errors that may occur during runtime.

Data Handling:
The application effectively manages data across different categories. It employs reasonable structuring practices to organize and manipulate data seamlessly.

Route Management:
With a variety of HTTP request methods, including GET, POST, PATCH/PUT, and DELETE, the application offers comprehensive route management for data manipulation. It also utilizes query parameters and route parameters for data filtering.

View Rendering:
Utilizing a template engine with Express.js, the application renders views to provide a user-friendly interface. This includes rendering views to display the current state of the API's data and interaction via HTML forms.

Code Organization and Error Handling:
Adhering to best practices, the application maintains clean and organized code. It runs smoothly without errors, ensuring a seamless user experience. Any potential issues are effectively managed and addressed within the codebase.

Bonus Objectives:
Regular Expressions Usage
To enhance route path handling, I've incorporated practical usage of regular expressions where appropriate. This adds flexibility and efficiency to route management within the application.

Third-Party Package Integration:
In pursuit of innovation, I've integrated a third-party Node package for specific functionalities. This demonstrates a willingness to explore and leverage external resources to enhance application capabilities.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the Express Server Application project has been a fulfilling experience, allowing me to demonstrate my expertise in Node.js and Express.js while exploring new avenues for improvement. I look forward to applying these learnings in future endeavors.
